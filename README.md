# Modulation schemes
Modulation is the technique of super imposing one signal(carrier) over another signal(input signal). There are 2 kinds of modulation types, analog modulation and digital modulation.
There are 3 kinds of modulation techniques, Amplitude, phase, and frequency modulation techniques. These involve adjustments in amplitude, phase, and frequency components respectively in the 2 domains.
To implement both analog(AM,FM,PM) and digital modulation schemes(ASK,PSK,FSK).
